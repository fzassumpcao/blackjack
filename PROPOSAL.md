## Proposal
###Idea
For my final project, I am thinking of making a blackjack 
game using Cinder. I have played blackjack for a while 
am very familiar with how the game works, so the concept 
and rules will not be a problem to me. I think it is
a simple game in terms of rules but will not be extremely
easy to develop. I am very interested in poker and am
thinking about designing an app related to poker in the 
future so I think this project idea will be a very helpful
way for me to learn what and how I could that later since
Poker is a lot more complex.

###Timeline
In Week 1, I think I will mostly work on simply setting
everything up from complete scratch with Cinder and the 
game mechanics. I think I can possibly work on giving cards
to the player and dealer and making those show up in the
correct manner with Cinder.
######
In Week 2, I think I will be able to develop most of the
game mechanics, which include allowing the player to hit
or stand, how the dealer plays, and determining who won
a specific round.
######
In Week 3, I think I will work on finishing anything I 
was not able to from Week 2. I also will work on adding a
player balance, letting the player choose how much to bet on
each round, and adding the correct amount to the balance if 
they win.
######
If I have extra time, I could add more advanced graphics
as well as add more advanced blackjack mechanics, such as 
double-down, splitting, and insurance.
